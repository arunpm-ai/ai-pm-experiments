# Experiment 01 — GitHub Setup

## Problem
As a Product Manager, I want to learn AI-assisted building but lack a structured workspace to experiment.

## Hypothesis
Maintaining experiments publicly will accelerate learning and create a portfolio of real artifacts.

## Actions Taken
- Created GitHub profile
- Created AI PM experiments repository
- Established learning workflow

## Learnings
GitHub can be used as a product learning workspace, not just for engineers.

## Next Step
Build first AI-assisted prototype using Claude Code or Codex.
